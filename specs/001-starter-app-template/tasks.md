# Tasks: Starter App Template Infrastructure

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-starter-app-template/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are OPTIONAL and not included in this implementation plan unless explicitly requested.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Starter App**: `starter-app/src/` for Next.js application code
- **Infrastructure**: `infra/` for database migrations and configuration

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (P1): Can start after Phase 2 - No dependencies on other stories
  - User Story 2 (P2): Can start after Phase 2 - Independent of other stories
  - User Story 3 (P2): Can start after Phase 2 - Should integrate with US2 for user accounts
  - User Story 4 (P3): Can start after Phase 2 - Should integrate with US2 (signup emails) and US3 (payment emails)
  - User Story 5 (P3): Can start after Phase 2 - Independent but applies to all UI
  - RAG Feature (P3): Can start after Phase 2 - Requires US2 for user authentication
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US2 for authenticated users
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with US2 and US3 for email triggers
- **User Story 5 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independently testable but affects all UI
- **RAG Feature (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Requires US2 for authentication

### Within Each User Story

- Setup phase before all others
- Foundational phase must complete before any user story
- Database migrations before services that use them
- Services before API endpoints
- API endpoints before UI components
- Core implementation before integration with other stories

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- UI components within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 2 (Authentication)

```bash
# Launch all parallel auth page tasks together:
Task: "Implement signup page with form validation in starter-app/src/app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx"
Task: "Implement signin page with form validation in starter-app/src/app/(auth)/signin/page.tsx"
Task: "Implement password reset request page in starter-app/src/app/(auth)/reset-password/page.tsx"
Task: "Implement password reset confirmation page in starter-app/src/app/(auth)/reset-password/confirm/page.tsx"
Task: "Create protected dashboard route in starter-app/src/app/(dashboard)/dashboard/page.tsx"
Task: "Create profile management page in starter-app/src/app/(dashboard)/profile/page.tsx"
Task: "Create auth form components (inputs, buttons, validation) in starter-app/src/components/auth/"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Bootstrap experience)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

**MVP Delivers**: Developers can clone template, add environment variables, and launch a functional Next.js app with working landing page, theme toggle, and health check dashboard in under 15 minutes.

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 (Auth) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 (Payments) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 (Email) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 5 (Theming) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
7. Add RAG Feature ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
8. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Bootstrap)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Auth)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Payments)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (Email)
   - Developer E: User Story 5 (Theming)
   - Developer F: RAG Feature
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Tests are OPTIONAL and not included unless explicitly requested
- Focus on template infrastructure - avoid deep feature customization
- Prioritize environment-variable-only configuration
- Follow mm-design-system principles for all UI components
